                        <p>
                            My interest in programming started when I was 13 years old, <br />
                            I was working on some small electronic projects in my garage,
                            after some time, I wanted to do more but I didn&apos;t have
                            enough tools to build bigger things
                            (trying to make my own Fansworth Fusor.. I was a bit crazy back then).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That&apos;s when I discovered the world of programming
                            by watching some videos,
                            I started to understand that it could allow me to create
                            anything I wanted even without any real budget or tools.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I started to learn programming by myself with a game engine called
                            Game Maker 6, I was able to create some small games and share
                            them with my friends, after a bit, I became pretty good at it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It followed by a few years of learning and experimenting with
                            different programming languages and frameworks, dreaming about
                            creating my own video games, but I was always missing something,
                            probably professional experience and a real project to work on.

                        <p>
                            In 2022, I decided to take the plunge and started a new career as a
                            web developer, allowing me to combine my passion for programming
                            and my interest in the web.
                            I was able to find a job as a web developer in a new company
                            and I&apos;m currently working on a big project with my colleagues.
