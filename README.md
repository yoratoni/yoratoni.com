## About this website
It's technically my first real website ! So I decided to use a complex path instead of just building
a simple website, I started by using a Debian 11 VPS hosted with Hostinger, where I configured everything
without any control panel (don't ask me why..), and the DNS custom zone (Bind9 / named) part was really funny, it took me "only" a week to understand how it works .. and another to make it work.. And for the front-end, just some React with animate.css and Typescript.

## But why ?
Because it gave me some practice, actually, a lot of practice, something like 100 commits for just a basic website.
I wanted everything to be perfect, it is not, yet. But this website will evolute at the
same time as my career.
