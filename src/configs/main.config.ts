        `I started programming in <b>2015</b>, after doing a lot of <b>DIY</b> projects in my workshop,
        I wanted to create stuff without being limited by the physical world (aka. money).

        I discovered that it was possible to create anything I wanted with a computer,
        no need for money or tools anymore, a lot of people were dedicating their time to
        build open-source tools and libraries that anyone could use for free, and I wanted
        to be part of this community.

        I started to learn <b>GML</b>, a programming language for a game engine called <b>Game Maker 8</b>.`,
